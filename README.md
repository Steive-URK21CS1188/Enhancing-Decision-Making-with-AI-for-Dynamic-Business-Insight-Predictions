# Enhancing-Decision-Making-with-AI-for-Dynamic-Business-Insight-Predictions
The project utilizes a hybrid modeling approach to address key business challenges by leveraging historical data. It integrates multiple machine learning models, each tailored to a specific objective. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is employed for time-series forecasting, allowing accurate predictions of future sales and revenue by analyzing trends, seasonality, and past patterns. Linear Regression is used for profit prediction by modeling the relationship between revenue, cost, and other influencing business variables. To support pricing strategies, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression helps optimize prices based on historical pricing performance and market response.
These models are trained and validated using historical data, and their performance is evaluated through established metrics like RMSE, R², and MAE.
The system's results are presented through a dynamic Streamlit dashboard, enabling real-time interaction with the models. Business analysts and decision-makers can input new data, explore different scenarios, and visualize the impact of changes in pricing, sales strategies, and customer segmentation.
By integrating these machine learning techniques into a user-friendly platform, the AI-driven business insight system helps organizations improve decision-making, optimize pricing strategies, and segment customers effectively. The system's adaptability also allows for future enhancements, such as incorporating deep learning models, expanding dashboard functionalities, and addressing additional business challenges, like inventory management or marketing campaign optimization. This system presents a powerful tool for organizations looking to leverage AI for smarter, data-driven decision-making.
